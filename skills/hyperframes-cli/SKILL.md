# HyperFrames CLI

Everything runs through `npx hyperframes`. Requires Node.js >= 22 and FFmpeg.

## Workflow

1. **Scaffold** — `npx hyperframes init my-video` (or `capture` from a URL)
2. **Write** — author HTML composition (see the `hyperframes-core` skill)
3. **Lint** — `npx hyperframes lint`
4. **Validate** — `npx hyperframes validate` (runtime errors + contrast)
5. **Visual inspect** — `npx hyperframes inspect`
6. **Preview** — `npx hyperframes preview`
7. **Render** — `npx hyperframes render`

Lint, validate, and inspect before preview. `lint` catches missing `data-composition-id`, overlapping tracks, and unregistered timelines. `validate` loads the composition in headless Chrome and reports runtime console errors plus WCAG contrast issues. `inspect` seeks through the timeline and reports text spilling out of bubbles/containers or off the canvas.

## Scaffolding

```bash
npx hyperframes init my-video                        # interactive wizard
npx hyperframes init my-video --example warm-grain   # pick an example
npx hyperframes init my-video --video clip.mp4        # with video file
npx hyperframes init my-video --audio track.mp3       # with audio file
npx hyperframes init my-video --example blank --tailwind # with Tailwind v4 browser runtime
npx hyperframes init my-video --non-interactive       # skip prompts (CI/agents)
```

Templates: `blank`, `warm-grain`, `play-mode`, `swiss-grid`, `vignelli`, `decision-tree`, `kinetic-type`, `product-promo`, `nyt-graph`.

`init` creates the right file structure, copies media, transcribes audio with Whisper when requested, and installs AI coding skills. Use it instead of creating files by hand.

When using `--tailwind`, invoke the `hyperframes-tailwind` skill before editing classes or theme tokens. The scaffold uses Tailwind v4 browser runtime patterns, not Studio's Tailwind v3 setup.

## Website Capture

```bash
npx hyperframes capture https://stripe.com                  # scaffold from a website
npx hyperframes capture https://linear.app -o linear-video  # custom output directory
npx hyperframes capture https://example.com --json          # JSON output for agents
npx hyperframes capture https://example.com --skip-assets   # skip image/SVG download
npx hyperframes capture https://example.com --max-screenshots 12
npx hyperframes capture https://example.com --timeout 60000 # page-load timeout in ms
```

Captures a live URL as an editable HyperFrames project: screenshots become layered scenes, assets are downloaded locally, and the result is a normal project you can `lint` / `preview` / `render`. Use this when the user supplies a URL as the starting point for a video.

## Skills Install

```bash
npx hyperframes skills    # install HyperFrames skills for AI coding tools
```

One-time setup that adds the HyperFrames skill pack (composition core, creative, captions, registry, media, gsap, tailwind, cli) to the local AI coding environment so agents follow the framework conventions. Re-run after major HyperFrames upgrades.

## Linting

```bash
npx hyperframes lint                  # current directory
npx hyperframes lint ./my-project     # specific project
npx hyperframes lint --verbose        # info-level findings
npx hyperframes lint --json           # machine-readable
```

Lints `index.html` and all files in `compositions/`. Reports errors (must fix), warnings (should fix), and info (with `--verbose`).

## Validate

```bash
npx hyperframes validate              # current directory
npx hyperframes validate ./my-project # specific project
npx hyperframes validate --json       # agent-readable findings
npx hyperframes validate --timeout 5000
```

Static lint is fast but blind to runtime failures. `validate` loads the composition in headless Chrome, plays through it, and reports:

- JavaScript console errors and unhandled exceptions
- Failed network requests (with media-file aborts filtered out)
- WCAG AA contrast violations on visible text (foreground/background sampled at key frames)

Run `validate` before `inspect` when an animation has scripts, fetched data, or theming. Combine with `render --strict` in CI.

## Visual Inspect

```bash
npx hyperframes inspect                 # inspect rendered layout over the timeline
npx hyperframes inspect ./my-project    # specific project
npx hyperframes inspect --json          # agent-readable findings
npx hyperframes inspect --samples 15    # denser timeline sweep
npx hyperframes inspect --at 1.5,4,7.25 # explicit hero-frame timestamps
```

Use this after `lint` and `validate`, especially for compositions with speech bubbles, cards, captions, or tight typography. It reports:

- Text extending outside the nearest visual container or bubble
- Text clipped by its own fixed-width/fixed-height box
- Text extending outside the composition canvas
- Children escaping clipping containers

Errors should be fixed before rendering. Warnings are surfaced for agent review; add `--strict` to fail on warnings too. Repeated static issues are collapsed by default so JSON output stays compact for LLM context windows. If overflow is intentional for an entrance/exit animation, mark the element or ancestor with `data-layout-allow-overflow`. If a decorative element should never be audited, mark it with `data-layout-ignore`.

`npx hyperframes layout` remains available as a compatibility alias for the same visual inspection pass.

## Snapshot

```bash
npx hyperframes snapshot                       # 5 key frames as PNG
npx hyperframes snapshot ./my-project          # specific project
npx hyperframes snapshot --frames 10           # evenly-spaced N frames
```

Captures still PNGs from the composition for visual diffing, thumbnails, or attaching to a PR. Faster than rendering a video when you only need a few hero frames. Output lands in the project's snapshots directory.

## Previewing

```bash
npx hyperframes preview                   # serve current directory
npx hyperframes preview --port 4567       # custom port (default 3002)
```

Hot-reloads on file changes. Opens the studio in your browser automatically.

When handing a project back to the user, use the Studio project URL, not the
source `index.html` path:

```text
http://localhost:<port>/#project/<project-name>
```

Use the actual port from the preview output and the project directory name. For
example, after `npx hyperframes preview --port 3017` in `codex-openai-video`,
report `http://localhost:3017/#project/codex-openai-video`.

Treat `index.html` as source-code context only. It is fine to link it as an
implementation file, but do not label it as the project or preview surface.

### Play (lightweight player)

```bash
npx hyperframes play                  # current project, port 3003
npx hyperframes play ./my-video       # specific project
npx hyperframes play --port 8080      # custom port
```

`play` serves the composition through the embeddable `<hyperframes-player>` web component instead of the full Studio UI. Use it when sharing a preview link or when Studio is heavier than needed (no editor, no panels). Requires `bun run build` to have produced the runtime + player bundles.

## Registry

`npx hyperframes add` and `npx hyperframes catalog` install reusable blocks and components from the registry into a project. For the install commands, target paths, sub-composition wiring, and component snippet merging, invoke the `hyperframes-registry` skill — that skill owns the registry workflow so this skill stays focused on the dev loop.

## Rendering

```bash
npx hyperframes render                                # standard MP4
npx hyperframes render --output final.mp4             # named output
npx hyperframes render --quality draft                # fast iteration
npx hyperframes render --fps 60 --quality high        # final delivery
npx hyperframes render --format webm                  # transparent WebM
npx hyperframes render --docker                       # byte-identical
```

| `--variables-file`   | path                  | —                          | JSON file with variable values (alternative to `--variables`)      |
| `--strict-variables` | flag                  | off                        | Fail render on undeclared keys or type mismatches in `--variables` |

**Quality guidance:** `draft` while iterating, `standard` for review, `high` for final delivery.

**Parametrized renders:** the composition declares its variables on the `<html>` root with **`data-composition-variables`** — a JSON **array of declarations** (`{id, type, label, default}` per entry) that defines the schema. Scripts inside read the resolved values via `window.__hyperframes.getVariables()`. The CLI **`--variables '{"title":"Q4 Report"}'`** is a JSON **object keyed by id** that overrides those declared defaults for one render; missing keys fall through, so the same composition runs unchanged in dev preview and in production. Sub-comp hosts can also override per-instance with **`data-variable-values`**. See the `hyperframes-core` skill for the full pattern.

## Publish

```bash
npx hyperframes publish              # upload current project, return public URL
npx hyperframes publish ./my-video   # specific project
npx hyperframes publish --yes        # skip the confirmation prompt (scripts/CI)
```

Uploads the project's source (HTML + assets) and returns a stable public URL that renders in the browser. Use this for sharing a draft for review before rendering MP4, or for embedding the composition elsewhere. Lint findings are surfaced before upload but do not block.

## Asset Preprocessing

`npx hyperframes tts`, `transcribe`, and `remove-background` produce assets (narration audio, word-level transcripts, transparent video) that get dropped into a composition. Each may download its own model on first run. For voice selection, Whisper model rules, output format choice, and the TTS to transcript to captions chain, invoke the `hyperframes-media` skill.

## Troubleshooting

```bash
npx hyperframes doctor       # check environment (Chrome, FFmpeg, Node, memory)
npx hyperframes browser      # manage bundled Chrome
npx hyperframes info         # version and environment details
npx hyperframes upgrade      # check for updates
```

Run `doctor` first if rendering fails. Common issues: missing FFmpeg, missing Chrome, low memory.

## Other

```bash
npx hyperframes compositions          # list compositions in project
npx hyperframes docs                  # open documentation
npx hyperframes benchmark .           # benchmark render performance
npx hyperframes telemetry status      # show telemetry state
npx hyperframes telemetry disable     # disable anonymous usage telemetry
npx hyperframes telemetry enable      # re-enable telemetry
```

Telemetry is anonymous usage counters only. Disable globally with `HYPERFRAMES_NO_TELEMETRY=1` if env-var control is preferred over the subcommand.
