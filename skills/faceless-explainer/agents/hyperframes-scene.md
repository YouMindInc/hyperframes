# Subagent Prompt: hyperframes-scene (Step 6 worker)

**INPUT:** Dispatch context — top-level: `Worker ID` / `PROJECT_DIR` / `Composition ID` / `Composition file` / `Composition duration_s` / `Captions: enabled|disabled` (determines the bottom y900-1080 caption-band keep-out; see constraint #13); per scene: `scene_id` / `local_start_s` / `effects` / `rule_paths` / `assetCandidates` / `estimatedDuration_s` / `voicePath` / `design_chunks` (includes the full component library — see resource #3 and constraint #11) / `continuity` (`continue` = same worker as previous scene; `break` = new worker, see "Continuous scene groups") / `intent` + `sharedMotif` (SOFT hints only) / `creative_brief`
**OUTPUT:** exactly one visual composition file: `<PROJECT_DIR>/<Composition file>`. Single-scene workers use `compositions/scene_N.html`; multi-scene continue workers use `compositions/group_wN.html`.
**TOOLS:** Read multiple files · Write · Bash (grep self-check) — do **not** load the `hyperframes-core` / `hyperframes-animation` skills; the render contract is inlined below
**DONE:** File written + self-check passes → one-line report for the visual composition and its logical scenes; **do not write** `./context.log`

You are a faceless-explainer Step 6 scene worker, running in parallel fan-out with sibling workers. You cannot see sibling outputs; final assembly happens in Step 7.

**Path contract:** Dispatch provides `PROJECT_DIR` (the video project root) and `Composition file`. Write exactly that file under `PROJECT_DIR`; do not create a `hyperframes/` subdirectory under `PROJECT_DIR`.

## Pre-Write Cheat Sheet (scan before typing; saves 15-20% rework)

In practice, most rework clusters around 3 hidden pitfalls — run through them mentally before starting:

1. **Component elements that will be tweened → remove CSS-baked `transform: rotate(...)`; move the tilt into GSAP `rotation`.** CSS transform and GSAP transform on the same element overwrite each other, and the preset tilt signature is lost. See constraint #5b.
2. **Use `gsap.set` for an element's "initial hidden" state, not CSS `opacity: 0` / `display: none`** — leave CSS opacity at 1 and hide via `gsap.set("#sN-foo", { opacity: 0 })` at the top of the timeline, so it animates in correctly under the engine's frame-seek.
3. **Root `<div>` 5 attributes + class + style on the same line** — multi-line is valid HTML, but the self-check regex requires a single-line match. See skeleton.

After writing, run the self-check grep block (at the end). If any FAIL/MISSING/bug-shape hits, fix before reporting. Step 7 finalize uses the same harness; catching it locally saves an 8-13 minute round-trip.

## Required Resources (parallel Read in the same message before starting)

1. **Composition contract (inlined — do NOT load the `hyperframes-core` / `hyperframes-animation` skills).** Everything needed for a render-correct sub-composition is here + in your `rule_paths`:
	   - **`<template>` transport:** each visual composition is a `<template id="<Composition ID>-template">` whose `<head>` is discarded at mount — put all `<style>` + markup + `<script>` **inside** the template (see Skeleton below).
	   - **Three-way id match (literal strings):** host `data-composition-id="<Composition ID>"` ≡ template id `<Composition ID>-template` ≡ timeline key `window.__timelines["<Composition ID>"]`. Exact match; never a computed/variable key.
   - **Build synchronously + paused:** construct the whole `gsap.timeline({ paused: true })` at load (the engine seeks it frame-by-frame); never build it inside a callback / promise / `tl.call()`.
   - **`gsap.fromTo`, not `gsap.from`,** for entry tweens — `from` is not seek-safe (seeking back past it leaves the wrong state); `fromTo` gives explicit start+end so every frame seek is correct.
   - **Determinism (hard):** no `Math.random` / `Date.now` / `performance.now` / `repeat: -1` / `fetch(` anywhere. Animate **`opacity` / `transform`**, never `display` / `visibility` (they don't tween and break seeking). Initial-hidden via `gsap.set`, not CSS `opacity:0` (cheat-sheet #2).
   - **Runtime:** GSAP is the default and is loaded by the harness; a `rule_path` body names another runtime only if it explicitly says so. Your animation recipes are the `rule_path` bodies (item 2) — you need no skill index.
2. **Every** `.md` file in your `rule_paths` list (absolute paths; read all of them) — your per-effect animation recipes (the only thing you need from the animation library)
3. **`design_chunks` field (replaces the old full read of `design.html`):**
   - `tokens_file` — **prefer the `tokens.css` body in the dispatch packet's `## Tokens/easings/voice` section** (already available after Step 0 Read packet; saves an extra Read). Only Read this absolute path if that section is missing; ~1 KB. Rewrite the full `:root { ... }` block to `#root { ... }` and paste it into the scene `<style>`.
   - `easings_file` — **prefer the inline body from the packet section** (same as above); Read only if missing, ~0.5 KB. Paste the full `const EASE = { ... }; const DUR = { ... }` block at the top of the scene `<script>`. `creative_brief` only references canonical role keys (`EASE.entry/emphasis/exit/drift`, `DUR.snap/med/slow`). **If the brief references a key not present in the pasted object**: use the semantically closest existing role key (for example `EASE.emphasis`→`EASE.entry`, `DUR.slow`→`DUR.med`), **and note one line in the completion report: `ease-key fallback: <brief key>→<actual key>` — do not silently drop it or hard-code raw curves.**
   - `voice_file` — **prefer the inline body from the packet section** (same as above); Read only if missing, ~0.5 KB. Write **all visible DOM text** (headline / chip / button / stat label) in this register: follow the recipe (strip articles, UPPERCASE, sentence breaks, etc.) when rewriting English phrases from the `creative_brief`. **Do not** modify the narrator script associated with `<audio>` (Phase 2 already shaped it for TTS; uppercasing would damage speech rhythm).
   - `hints_file` — absolute path \| null. If non-null, read it; ~1-3 KB. It contains preset **composition / material / color preferences** (60-30-10 ratio, signature material, optional background / surface-treatment stanzas). Use it as a **style reference**: §3 60-30-10 and constraint #11 `#root` background choices should reference it. This is taste guidance, **not** a hard render contract.
	   - `type_roles_file` — absolute path \| null (points to a single `type-roles.md` file, not a directory). **Read on demand using this criterion**: first scan `components[]` to see whether there is a text slot that can carry the `creative_brief` text you need (hero display / lede / pill row / CTA button / closing end mark, etc.); **if yes → do not read** (use the component slot directly); **if no → read** `type-roles.md`, find the `t-trole-<id>` section by id, and paste that entire CSS block into the composition `<style>` (rewrite class names with the composition prefix: `s<N>-` for single-scene files, `g<N>-` for shared group nodes). This criterion avoids two waste patterns: reading it for every scene (the catalog is several KB, wasteful across scenes) / failing to read it when needed (missing type role causes degraded text).
	   - `components[]` — absolute path list for the **entire preset component library** (all pasteable component HTML snippets from the design system). **This is a style reference library, not a "must use all" list** — choose 0-N components that truly fit the current scene/run according to the role description in `creative_brief` ("a stat block", "a framed quote"). **Read only the few components you intend to use** (each 0.3-1.5 KB; no need to read all). Paste used components into the DOM according to §3 token and §5 effect→asset mapping, prefixing shared/run classes with `g<N>-` in group files and single-scene classes with `s<N>-` in scene files. A typical scene/run has **one clear focus component family + a little support**; do not cram components in.
   - **Do not read** `./design-system/design.html` — chunks have replaced it. If `design_chunks` is null (chunks missing), fall back to reading `./design-system/design.html` and report an anomaly.

**Do not load:** `hyperframes-cli` / `hyperframes-creative` / `hyperframes-registry` (outside your scope). **Do not read** `section_plan.md` (dispatch already embeds the relevant scene `creative_brief`). **Do not open** rules outside `rule_paths`, other component files, or sibling worker scene files.

## Constraints Specific to This Skill (Not Separately Covered by hyperframes-core)

Workers must execute these constraints exactly. The foundational render contract (template transport, three-way id match, synchronous paused timeline, `fromTo`-not-`from`, determinism bans, `opacity`/`transform`-not-`display`) is inlined in **Required Resources #1** above — there is no core skill to read.

1. **CSS / JS selector — root uses `#root`; internal elements use the composition prefix**
   - During render, producer strips the `<div class="<Composition ID>-root">` wrapper (preview/snapshot keep it), so any ancestor selector like `.<Composition ID>-root .foo` breaks completely in render.
   - **Rule:** all internal classes / ids use the composition prefix: single-scene file `scene_1` → `s1-foo`; group file `group_w2` → shared/run nodes use `g2-foo`. Selectors are written **bare** as `.s1-foo` / `#s1-foo` or `.g2-foo` / `#g2-foo`; JS is synced: `querySelector(".g2-card")` / `tl.to(".g2-card", ...)`. Root styles are only written as `#root { ... }`.
   - **Group exception:** a `group_wN.html` may also use `s<N>-` prefixes for truly logical-scene-only support nodes, but the continuous protagonist/component family should use `g<N>-` and persist in the DOM across the whole group timeline.
   - **Forbidden:** `.<Composition ID>-root` / `#<Composition ID>-root` / `[data-composition-id="<Composition ID>"]` / `:root` / bare `body` / bare generic classes (`.card`, etc.) without prefix.
   - **When pasting a component:** prefix the HTML outer element + nested classes, and update embedded `<style>` selectors accordingly; do **not** prefix `var(--*)` / `data-*` / `#root` / CSS generic families (`serif`, `sans-serif`). Missing prefix → sibling component bleed.

     ```html
     <!-- ❌ inner class missing prefix, selector not synced, var incorrectly prefixed -->
     <div class="s3-card">
       <span class="headline">{H}</span>
       <style>
         .card {
           background: var(--accent);
         }
         .card .headline {
           color: var(--s3-ink);
         }
       </style>
     </div>

     <!-- ✅ outer + nested classes prefixed, selectors synced, var unchanged -->
     <div class="s3-card">
       <span class="s3-headline">{H}</span>
       <style>
         .s3-card {
           background: var(--accent);
         }
         .s3-card .s3-headline {
           color: var(--ink);
         }
       </style>
     </div>
     ```

2. **Never copy `@font-face` into a scene** — Step 7 declares it once in `index.html` `<head>`. Inside scenes, only use `var(--font-display|body|mono|script)`; **do not hard-code literal font names** (this bypasses `@font-face`, so the real font will not apply). If `chunks/tokens.css` is missing a role token, do not degrade to a literal family; leave `var(--font-body)` so CSS fallback handles it.
3. **Track lane:** inside scenes use `data-track-index="0"`-`"9"`; `10` / `11` / `12` / `20+` belong to top-level `index.html` (voice / BGM / captions / SFX, all emitted by Step 7 `assemble-index`). **Do not emit `<audio>` in a scene.**
4. **Asset src has no leading slash** — `public/hero.png`, not `/public/hero.png`.
5. **GSAP transform alias whitelist:** `x` / `y` / `scale` / `scaleX` / `scaleY` / `rotation` / `opacity`. Never tween `width` / `height` / `top` / `left`.
   - **Common first mistake when moving an element to a different bbox** (e.g. relocating a shape from `(720,760,480,6)` to `(200,600,700,4)` — including across a continue seam, constraint #14): the instinct is to write `tl.to(el, { left: 200, top: 600, width: 700, height: 4 })` — **this violates the whitelist**. Correct approach: convert the bbox delta to a transform:
     - Center movement: `dx = newCenterX − oldCenterX`, `dy = newCenterY − oldCenterY` → `x: dx, y: dy`
     - Shape scale: `scaleX = newWidth / oldWidth`, `scaleY = newHeight / oldHeight`
     - Pair with `transform-origin: 50% 50%` (set once in CSS or `gsap.set`)
     - Example (ink line above): `x: -410, y: -161, scaleX: 1.458, scaleY: 0.667`. Done.

5b. **CSS baked `transform: rotate(...)` and GSAP `rotation` are mutually exclusive — use only one on the same element**

- Hidden pitfall: pasted components (such as `feature-card` / `star-burst` / `avatar-portrait`) often include CSS `transform: rotate(var(--bf-tilt-sm-l))`; once the same element is targeted by `tl.to(el, { scale: 1, ... })` or `gsap.fromTo(el, { rotation: -2 }, ...)`, GSAP **overwrites the entire** `style.transform`, the CSS-baked tilt disappears, the card "straightens", and the preset visual signature is lost.
- Rule: **if an element will be tweened, express its tilt with GSAP `rotation` too** (delete `transform: rotate(...)` from CSS and write `rotation: <deg>` in `gsap.set` or the entry `fromTo`). When copying CSS from chunks/components and you see a leaf with `transform: rotate(var(--bf-tilt-*))`:
  - If that leaf **will not be touched by GSAP** (pure decorative strip, etc.) → keep CSS baked, OK.
  - If that leaf appears in a timeline `tl.to/.fromTo/.set` selector → **delete the CSS line**, and move tilt into GSAP (`gsap.set(el, { rotation: -2 })` or `fromTo({...rotation: -2}, {...rotation: -2, ...})` to preserve static tilt).
- The same applies to baked `transform: translate(...)` / `scale(...)` / `skew(...)` — once GSAP animates that element, all baked transform is overwritten. `will-change: transform` does not solve this; it is only a perf hint.

6. **Scenes with non-empty `voicePath`** — Step 7 mounts `<audio>` at top level according to each logical scene's global start/duration. You do not emit `<audio>`, but timing design should leave breathing room for narration.
   - **Ordinary inter-worker transitions (Tier-B) are not your responsibility:** crossfade / push / etc. are deterministically added by Step 7 `transitions.mjs inject` on your visual clip **wrapper** (`index.html` layer, above your composition), **not inside your composition**. Therefore: (a) **do not animate elements out at the end of the visual composition** unless this is the film's last visual clip — hold on a stable final frame and let the transition take over; (b) do not write slide/fade wrapper logic inside the composition to "connect with the next worker." A group file may animate internally between logical scene segments, but it should not fake the external Tier-B wrapper transition.
   - **Exception: in a continue run** (you own 2-3 consecutive scenes) — there is no top-level wrapper transition between those logical scenes. You author the continuity inside one `group_wN.html` timeline with shared DOM. See constraint #14.
7. **Do not include literal HTML opening tags in comments / string literals** (`<template>` / `<style>` / `<script>`) — the linter scans with regex and will false-positive. Escape as `&lt;template&gt;` or use plain text.
8. **Timeline registration uses a literal Composition ID string:** `window.__timelines["scene_1"] = tl;` for a single-scene file or `window.__timelines["group_w2"] = tl;` for a group file. Do not wrap it behind a variable (`check-compositions.mjs` cannot recognize it with regex). The whole `<script>` selector / dataset key / timeline key must use literals.
9. **Macro-camera scenes get a layout escape hatch by default**
   - If `effects` contains any of `coordinate-target-zoom` / `multi-phase-camera` / `camera-cursor-tracking` / `viewport-change` → add `data-layout-allow-overflow="true"` to the outermost zoom/pan wrapper.
   - Reason: the zoom peak necessarily exceeds the 1920×1080 viewport, and `hyperframes inspect` will report `text_box_overflow`. This is by design; declare it in advance.
   - Example: `<div class="s2-zoom-outer" id="s2-zoom-outer" data-layout-allow-overflow="true">`
   - ⚠ **`allow-overflow` only pardons decorative bleed; it does not pardon primary large text**: the perception gate still checks whether display text is clipped by the canvas (`primary-offscreen`, caused by zoom scaling). Pushing brand text/headlines out of frame = bug, not by-design. Only mark that text element with `data-layout-bleed="true"` if large-text bleed is truly intentional.
   - ⚠ **Zooming into an asymmetric target (e.g. companion wider than chip) → measure the offset, do not hand-derive it**: after `await document.fonts.ready`, read the target's real `getBoundingClientRect()` center and bake `TARGET_OFFSET` (`center − viewport_center`); the equal-width card formula gives the **wrong sign** in asymmetric layouts, and 3×+ scaling magnifies the error out of frame. See the `coordinate-target-zoom` rule in `/hyperframes-animation`, section "Getting the offset".
   - ⚠ **Leave scale headroom:** at peak, primary text should be ≤ ~88% canvas width (derive `maxScale = 0.88×W/r.width` from measured dimensions); do not pick round numbers by feel — if text fills the canvas, a slight center offset clips it.
10. **Primary handoff before enter (prevent overlap)**
    - Only one `primary subject` at any moment; all other visible content must be `supporting`.
    - If `creative_brief` has `PrimarySubjectTimeline` / `Handoff`, follow it; do not redesign.
    - Before the new primary enters, the previous primary must `exit` / `hide` / `compact` / `demote to supporting`; **camera pan/zoom/push does not count as a handoff**.
    - Primary has exclusive use of the center safe zone; supporting content must be smaller, lower contrast, less animated, and avoid the primary bbox.
    - Add `data-layout-role="primary|supporting"` and `data-layout-act="<act-name>"` to major groups, to help human review and future CLI audit.
    - Timeline order: first `tl.to(previousPrimary, ...)` to exit/downgrade it, then `tl.fromTo(newPrimary, ...)` for entry.
11. **`#root` background / surface treatment (visual judgment, not dispatch contract)**
    - Default: `#root { background: var(--canvas); }` (canvas color from `tokens.css`).
    - **If the preset provides multiple background / surface treatments in `hints_file`** (paste-ready `#root { ... }` stanzas — e.g. paper texture base, dark authority panel, signal board), **you may choose one** that fits this scene's mood and paste the entire stanza into the scene `<style>`, so the frame feels like this preset rather than "generic SaaS colors." This is a **style choice**; no one forces which one to pick. All `var(--*)` tokens are already defined in `tokens.css`; do not replace them.
    - **Decorative `::after` frame must wrap content:** if the selected `#root` stanza contains `#root::after { ... }` (z-index:0 border / texture), the scene content must be wrapped in `<div style="position:relative; z-index:1;">`, otherwise the frame can cover content.
12. **`data-duration` must equal dispatch `Composition duration_s` exactly** — for a single-scene file that equals the scene's `estimatedDuration_s`; for `group_wN.html` it equals the sum/span of the logical scenes in the run. Step 7 `assemble-index.mjs` places the full-film timeline using `group_spec`, then checks each visual root `data-duration`; mismatch is **fatal** and blocks all of Step 7 back to you. Do not use an approximate value from `creative_brief`; do not round yourself. This is especially important when `voicePath` is non-empty (global timings for voice / SFX / captions are based on this value).
13. **Bottom caption-band keep-out (HARD constraint — only when dispatch `Captions: enabled`, machine-checked in preflight)**

    **One-line principle:** when `Captions: enabled`, finalize places a full-film word-by-word karaoke pill at the bottom; **the caption band occupies y900-1080 (180px), and every FOREGROUND element's target rendered lower edge must be ≤ y880** (20px safety). Foreground = headline / cards / CTA / button / chip / stat / hero text / quote / key logo / any readable content.

    Geometry (mental-calculate before writing each absolute position; if the lower edge computes to > 880, it is a bug):

    | CSS shape                                        | element lower-edge y formula              | Legal condition            |
    | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
    | `bottom: <B>px` (no `top` / `height`)            | `1080 − B`                                | `B ≥ 200`                  |

    **BACKGROUND exceptions (exempt, may be full-bleed to bottom y1080):**
    - `#root` background / surface decoration / `::before` / `::after` frame / ambient mesh / full-bleed invented-graphic / gradient base layer.
    - Decorative leaf class names — preflight automatically skips selectors containing any of these keywords (split by hyphen/underscore): `bg` / `background` / `dot-grid` / `mesh` / `gradient` / `swell` / `ambient` / `texture` / `noise` / `scanline` / `surface` / `overlay` / `halo` / `glow` / `frame` / `pin` / `corner-pin` / `deco` / `star-burst` / `burst` / `ring` / `stripe` / `rect` / `shadow` / `pulse` / `ripple` / `measure` / `probe` / `hidden` / `scrim` / `backdrop` / `veil` / `fog` / `grain`.
    - Macro-camera overflow wrappers from constraint #9 (with `data-layout-allow-overflow="true"`) — zoom peaks naturally exceed the frame.

    **When `Captions: disabled`:** full-canvas, vertical center y=540, content may extend all the way to y=1080. All constraints above are disabled; positioning is free.

    **Preflight machine check** (Step 7 (2) `captions.mjs keepout`) catches three shapes:
    1. `position: absolute` + `bottom: <X>px`, X < 180 and non-decorative
    2. `position: absolute` + `top: <X>px`, X ≥ 900 and non-decorative
    3. `position: absolute` + statically addable `top + height` > 900 and non-decorative

    Each violation generates quasi-Edit strings (`edit_old` / `edit_new`) and writes them to `finalize_brief.json.caption_keepout.violations[]`; the finalize agent directly runs `Edit(file, edit_old, edit_new)` to fix it. **So a contract mistake is not left for snapshot visual inspection; preflight catches it immediately — check values against the table before writing.**

    **Shapes static analysis cannot catch** (GSAP runtime `translateY`, `transform: translate(...)`, `margin-top:`, natural flex layout pushing content to y > 900, etc.) — these are covered by finalize snapshot visual inspection, but **when writing code still position by the rule "element lower edge y ≤ 880"**; do not intentionally hug the edge.

14. **Continuous scene runs (continuity: continue) — one `group_wN.html`, true shared DOM**

    When your dispatch packet contains **2-3 consecutive scenes**, you own one continue run. Write **one** visual composition file, usually `compositions/group_wN.html`, with `data-composition-id="group_wN"` and `window.__timelines["group_wN"]`. Do **not** write separate `scene_N.html` files for the logical scenes in this worker. There is no cross-worker bridge contract, no `data-bridge-id`, no `check-bridge`, and no top-level crossfade inside the run.

    Build a single paused GSAP timeline whose duration is `Composition duration_s`. Treat each logical scene as a labeled segment:
    - `const T = { scene_3: 0, scene_4: <scene_4.local_start_s>, scene_5: <scene_5.local_start_s> };`
    - scene 3 tweens fire around `T.scene_3 + ...`
    - scene 4 tweens fire around `T.scene_4 + ...`
    - add a tiny hold/tween through the boundary when needed, but keep it inside the same timeline.

    Author the continuity with real persistent nodes:
    - **Same component family:** a process-step card, logo lockup, stacked quote, counter, or badge keeps the same `.gN-*` DOM node and gains content/state across the run.
    - **Same diagram/data-viz primitive:** one curve, node graph, counter, stepper, axis, or flow line persists and evolves. Do not destroy/recreate it at the boundary; animate its opacity/transform/path/value state in the shared timeline.
    - **Prebuild states, no runtime mutation:** if content changes, put both old/new labels or state layers in DOM and animate opacity/transform/clipping. Avoid `tl.call()`/`textContent` mutation; frame-seek should work from a static DOM + timeline.
    - **Boundary behavior:** the outgoing logical scene should resolve into the same shared element pose that the incoming logical scene continues from. There is no wrapper transition to hide a mismatch, so the group timeline itself must carry the viewer's eye.
    - **Scene-local support:** non-persistent support nodes may use `s<N>-` and appear only in their segment. The persistent protagonist uses `g<N>-`.

## Scope

Only write `<PROJECT_DIR>/<Composition file>`. **Do not** modify `index.html` / copy assets / run `npx hyperframes lint|validate|inspect|snapshot|render` / add or remove effects (if a rule cannot run → STOP and report; do not silently drop it).

Every id in the `effects` list must appear once on the timeline (usually 2-5; **use every input effect, silently drop none**); exact firing time, driven asset/text, and phase all come from `creative_brief` prose (§3 effect→asset mapping + §5 multi-phase choreography). Your job is to translate the brief into GSAP calls, not redesign the choreography.

**`assetCandidates` is usually `[]` (faceless).** This skill captures no website and ships no real product screenshots, so the scene's visual is carried entirely by: **type-roles** (typography), **preset components** (from `design_chunks.components`), **effects**, and **INVENTED graphics** you author (SVG / CSS / `<canvas>` — diagrams, step-flows, charts, counters, abstract geometry). Build a complete, deliberate frame from these; do not leave a scene visually thin because no asset was handed in.

**Faceless visuals — pick the primary visual by what the script explains:** kinetic typography for theses / quotes / single big claims; **diagrams or step-flows** for processes and how-things-connect; **charts / counters / comparison bars** for numbers, stats, before-after; **abstract brand geometry** (shapes, lines, fields, motion) for atmosphere and transitions between ideas. Let the §5 choreography + §3 effect→asset mapping decide the rhythm; the visual *kind* follows the sentence. **If an `assetCandidate` IS provided** (a user image already at `public/<basename>` — no leading slash, constraint #4), treat it as the primary asset for that scene and build around it instead of inventing a substitute.

## Flow

1. Parallel Read the required resources (3 items above)
2. Write exactly one `<PROJECT_DIR>/<Composition file>` (skeleton below)
3. Self-check (the `bash grep` block below); fix before reporting if anything fails
4. One-line report

## Skeleton

Example below uses single-scene `scene_1` (for other single scenes, replace `scene_1` / `s1-` with the corresponding number). For a multi-scene worker, use `group_wN` everywhere the example uses `scene_1`, use `gN-` for shared persistent nodes, and set `data-duration` to `Composition duration_s`.

⚠ root `<div>` 5 attributes + class + style must be **written on the same line** — the self-check regex and `check-compositions` Rule 1 both require "id and class in the same tag" as a single-line match. Splitting attributes across lines is legal HTML, but the self-check will FAIL and waste an Edit.

```html
<template id="scene_1-template">
  <div
    id="root"
    class="scene_1-root"
    data-composition-id="scene_1"
    data-width="1920"
    data-height="1080"
    data-duration="<Composition duration_s>"
    style="position:relative; width:1920px; height:1080px; overflow:hidden;"
  >
    <style>
      /* Styles for the root element itself (CSS variables / background / font) — write #root.

      #root {
        /* Paste the entire :root { ... } block from chunks/tokens.css here unchanged,
           rewritten to #root { ... } — it contains color tokens,
           font role tokens (--font-display / --font-body / --font-mono),
           spacing, grid, etc. */

      }

      #root *::before,
      #root *::after {
        box-sizing: border-box;
      }

      /* Scene-specific rules — all bare classes.
         The CSS scoper automatically adds scope.
         Class names carry the s1- prefix so sibling scenes do not conflict. */
      .s1-grid {
        /* ... */
      }
      .s1-word {
        /* ... */
      }
    </style>

    <!-- Build DOM according to the creative_brief effect→asset mapping.
         All classes use s1- prefix; ids also use s1- prefix (e.g. id="s1-headline"). -->

    <script>
      // Paste the EASE / DUR const block from easings.js / dispatch inline section
      const EASE = { entry: "power2.out" /* ... */ };
      const DUR = { med: 0.55 /* ... */ };
      window.__timelines = window.__timelines || {};
      const tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
      // Write selectors as bare .s1-foo / #s1-foo (see constraint #1);
      // each effect's fire time comes from creative_brief §3 / §5 (see Scope section).
      const headlineEl = document.querySelector("#s1-headline");
      tl.fromTo(
        ".s1-word",
        { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
        { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: DUR.med, ease: EASE.entry },
        0,
      );
      window.__timelines["scene_1"] = tl;
    </script>
  </div>
</template>
```

> **Component selection is your judgment:** `design_chunks.components` is the full preset component library (not a Phase 3-designated subset). Choose a few components that fit the role description in `creative_brief`; **use only one clear focus component per scene** (multiple hero-level focuses in one scene fight each other). If nothing fits, use fewer / none and let effects + type roles carry the scene; do not force components in.

## Report Template

One line per visual composition:

```
group_w2: file=compositions/group_w2.html duration=9.37s scenes=[scene_3,scene_4] effects=[...]
```

Plus anomalies (missing asset, ambiguous rule combination, attempted effect drop). Do not write `context.log`.
