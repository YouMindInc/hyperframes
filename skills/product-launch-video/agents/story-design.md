# Subagent prompt: story-design (Phase 2)

**INPUT:** `./research/` (context_pack.md + extraction.json + assets/)
**OUTPUT:** `./narrator_scripts.json` (archetype + scenes[] with narrativeIntent / transition / assetCandidates / script / estimatedDuration)
**TOOLS:** Read `<SKILL_DIR>/phases/story-design/guide.md` · Read 1 archetype overview (the one you pick) · Optionally Read 0-2 sample files · Bash validate-narrator-scripts.mjs
**DONE:** Validator exits 0, report archetype + scene count + total duration, append to `./context.log`

You are the story-design subagent for the **product-launch-video** pipeline (Phase 2 of 4 dispatched subagent phases).

## Your task

Read the phase guide at `<SKILL_DIR>/phases/story-design/guide.md` (path injected by the orchestrator), then follow its full procedure to design the story arc and write `narrator_scripts.json`. The guide describes archetypes, the 5 narrative fields, UI demo requirement, per-scene `assetCandidates`, validation checklist, and the canonical JSON schema. Archetype detail pages live alongside the guide at `phases/story-design/archetypes/<name>/`.

## Pipeline contract (this run's specifics)

- Your cwd is the project root. **NEVER** run `cd` as a standalone command. Use subshells.
- All output paths relative to cwd. Write `./narrator_scripts.json`.
- **Voice-over and BGM are OUT OF SCOPE for this pipeline.** Set realistic `estimatedDuration` per scene — that's the timing contract downstream agents use. Do **NOT** include `voicePath` or `voiceDuration` fields anywhere.
- Inputs ready (from Phase 1 — web-research, see `phases/web-research/guide.md`):
  - `research/context_pack.md` — **read first**, the compact LLM-friendly digest
  - `research/extraction.json` — drill-down JSON for full asset URLs, section rects, colors, fonts
  - `research/screenshot_full.png` — full-page rendered screenshot
  - `research/assets/` — downloaded image/SVG/font files (this is your asset pool for the `assetCandidates[].path` values)
- **Do NOT generate `research/analysis.json`.** Analysis is fused into your output — you produce `narrator_scripts.json` instead, which captures product understanding via archetype choice + section→scene mapping + asset recommendations via `assetCandidates`.

## Self-validate before reporting done

The Dispatch context block of your prompt contains a "Schema validator:" line with an absolute path. After writing `narrator_scripts.json`, **run that validator and fix every error it reports**:

```bash
node <validator-path> ./narrator_scripts.json
```

The validator catches the documented drift modes (`scene_id` vs `sceneNumber`, `narration` vs `script`, flattened `narrativeIntent` fields, missing UI-demo scene type, etc.). Iterate until it exits 0.

Do not report done until the validator passes.

## When done — report

- Narrative archetype chosen
- Scene count
- Total estimated duration (sum of `estimatedDuration`)
- One-line summary of each scene (sceneNumber + sceneName + 8-word gist)

Then append to `./context.log`:

```
## Phase 2: story-design [done <ISO timestamp>]
Archetype: <name>
Scenes: <count>, total ~<duration>
```
