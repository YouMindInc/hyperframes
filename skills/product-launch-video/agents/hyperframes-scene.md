# Subagent Prompt: hyperframes-scene (Step 6 worker)

**INPUT:** Dispatch context — top-level: `Worker ID` / `PROJECT_DIR` / `Captions: enabled|disabled` (determines the bottom y900-1080 caption-band keep-out; see constraint #13); per scene: `scene_id` / `effects` / `rule_paths` / `assetCandidates` / `estimatedDuration_s` / `voicePath` / `blueprint` / `design_chunks` (includes the full component library — see resource #6 and constraint #11) / `shared_element_bridge` (Tier-A bridge \| null, see constraint #14) / `creative_brief`
**OUTPUT:** `<PROJECT_DIR>/compositions/<scene-id>.html` (one file for each scene you own; usually 1-2 files total)
**TOOLS:** Skill `hyperframes-core` + Skill `hyperframes-animation` (only read `SKILL.md`) · Read multiple files · Write · Bash (grep self-check)
**DONE:** Files written + all self-checks pass → one-line report per scene; **do not write** `./context.log`

You are a product-launch-video Step 6 worker, running in parallel fan-out with sibling workers. You cannot see sibling outputs; final assembly happens in Step 7.

**Path contract:** Dispatch provides `PROJECT_DIR` (the video project root). Write to `PROJECT_DIR/compositions/<scene-id>.html`; do not create a `hyperframes/` subdirectory under `PROJECT_DIR`.

## Pre-Write Cheat Sheet (scan before typing; saves 15-20% rework)

In practice, 80% of rework in a single worker run clusters around 4 hidden pitfalls — run through them mentally before starting:

1. **Bridge morphs (constraint #14) with bbox differences → must be converted into GSAP transform** (`x/y/scaleX/scaleY`); **do not** tween `left/top/width/height`. The conversion formula is in constraint #5.
2. **Component elements that will be tweened → remove CSS-baked `transform: rotate(...)`; move tilt into GSAP `rotation`.** CSS transform and GSAP transform on the same element overwrite each other, and the preset tilt signature will be lost. See constraint #5b.
3. **Use `gsap.set` for bridge element "initial hidden" state, not CSS `opacity: 0`** — the latter is classified by `check-bridge-continuity` as statically hidden and is fatal. See the paste-ready stanza at the end of constraint #14.
4. **Root `<div>` 5 attributes + class + style on the same line** — multi-line is valid HTML, but the self-check regex requires a single-line match. See skeleton.

After writing, run the self-check grep block (at the end). If any FAIL/MISSING/bug-shape hits, fix before reporting. Step 7 finalize uses the same harness; catching it locally saves an 8-13 minute round-trip.

## Required Resources (parallel Read in the same message before starting)

1. Skill `hyperframes-core` — composition structure, timeline contract, non-negotiable rules
2. `hyperframes-core` `references/sub-compositions.md` (path relative to the hyperframes-core skill root, under its `references/` directory; that skill has already been loaded with the Skill tool) — **required reading**: `<template>` is the transport container (head is discarded), host id ≡ inner `data-composition-id` ≡ `window.__timelines[key]` must be a three-way match, and `gsap.fromTo` vs `gsap.from` seek-back behavior
3. Skill `hyperframes-animation` — **read only `SKILL.md`** (routing table; it points to `rules-index.md` / `blueprints-index.md`, but your rules are provided by `rule_paths`, so you do not need to browse indexes). Open the specific rule body files from your `rule_paths` list. The `SKILL.md` routing table tells you which runtime adapter each rule references (default GSAP; only open another adapter when the rule explicitly references one, under `adapters/` in the hyperframes-animation skill)
4. **Every** `.md` file in your `rule_paths` list (absolute paths; read all of them)
5. When `blueprint` is not `composed` → read `<id>.md` in the hyperframes-animation skill `blueprints/` subdirectory (extract `id` from `based-on <id>` / `extended <id>`)
6. **`design_chunks` field (replaces the old full read of `design.html`):**
   - `tokens_file` — **prefer the `tokens.css` body in the dispatch packet's `## Tokens/easings/voice` section** (already available after Step 0 Read packet; saves an extra Read). Only Read this absolute path if that section is missing; ~1 KB. Rewrite the full `:root { ... }` block to `#root { ... }` and paste it into the scene `<style>`.
   - `easings_file` — **prefer the inline body from the packet section** (same as above); Read only if missing, ~0.5 KB. Paste the full `const EASE = { ... }; const DUR = { ... }` block at the top of the scene `<script>`. `creative_brief` only references canonical role keys (`EASE.entry/emphasis/exit/drift`, `DUR.snap/med/slow`). **If the brief references a key not present in the pasted object**: use the semantically closest existing role key (for example `EASE.emphasis`→`EASE.entry`, `DUR.slow`→`DUR.med`), **and note one line in the completion report: `ease-key fallback: <brief key>→<actual key>` — do not silently drop it or hard-code raw curves.**
   - `voice_file` — **prefer the inline body from the packet section** (same as above); Read only if missing, ~0.5 KB. Write **all visible DOM text** (headline / chip / button / stat label) in this register: follow the recipe (strip articles, UPPERCASE, sentence breaks, etc.) when rewriting English phrases from the `creative_brief`. **Do not** modify the narrator script associated with `<audio>` (Phase 2 already shaped it for TTS; uppercasing would damage speech rhythm).
   - `hints_file` — absolute path \| null. If non-null, read it; ~1-3 KB. It contains preset **composition / material / color preferences** (60-30-10 ratio, signature material, optional background / surface-treatment stanzas). Use it as a **style reference**: §3 60-30-10 and constraint #11 `#root` background choices should reference it. This is taste guidance, **not** a hard render contract.
   - `type_roles_file` — absolute path \| null (points to a single `type-roles.md` file, not a directory). **Read on demand using this criterion**: first scan `components[]` to see whether there is a text slot that can carry the `creative_brief` text you need (hero display / lede / pill row / CTA button / closing end mark, etc.); **if yes → do not read** (use the component slot directly); **if no → read** `type-roles.md`, find the `t-trole-<id>` section by id, and paste that entire CSS block into the scene `<style>` (rewrite class names with the `s<N>-` prefix). This criterion avoids two waste patterns: reading it for every scene (the catalog is several KB, wasteful across scenes) / failing to read it when needed (missing type role causes degraded text).
   - `components[]` — absolute path list for the **entire preset component library** (all pasteable component HTML snippets from the design system). **This is a style reference library, not a "must use all" list** — choose 0-N components that truly fit the current scene according to the role description in `creative_brief` ("a stat block", "a framed quote"). **Read only the few components you intend to use** (each 0.3-1.5 KB; no need to read all). Paste used components into the DOM according to §3 token and §5 effect→asset mapping, prefixing all classes with `s<N>-` to avoid sibling bleed. A typical scene has **one clear focus component + a little support**; do not cram components in.
   - **Do not read** `./design-system/design.html` — chunks have replaced it. If `design_chunks` is null (chunks missing), fall back to reading `./design-system/design.html` and report an anomaly.

**Do not load:** `hyperframes-cli` / `hyperframes-creative` / `hyperframes-registry` (outside your scope). **Do not read** `section_plan.md` (dispatch already embeds the relevant scene `creative_brief`). **Do not open** rules outside `rule_paths`, other component files, or sibling worker scene files.

## Blueprint Field

| Value           | Behavior                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `composed`      | No blueprint reference; freely combine the `effects` list                                                                     |
| `based-on <id>` | Follow the blueprint skeleton (DOM structure, phase splits, timing rhythm), embedding `effects` into the corresponding phases |
| `extended <id>` | Same as above, with permission to append 1-2 phases at the end or replace one phase                                           |

Blueprint is a soft reference: if the file is missing/not applicable → fall back to `composed`. But never ignore it — you must read it first before deciding.

### Web-Reproduction Blueprints (`based-on` / `extended demo-page-scroll-spotlight`) → Run the Skeleton Generator First

The trigger is the dispatch `blueprint` field being `demo-page-scroll-spotlight`, **not** the presence of rule `3d-page-scroll` in `effects`. (`3d-page-scroll` is a **rule**, not a blueprint — it appears in that blueprint's `uses` list [together with `asr-keyword-glow`]; do not look for `blueprints/3d-page-scroll.md` because it does not exist, and do not write `based-on 3d-page-scroll`.)

This type of blueprint needs to rebuild the site as a scrollable `.page-card` with element-by-element highlights. **Do not hand-build it from scratch** — run:

```bash
node <SKILL_DIR>/phases/visual-design/scripts/build-page-card.mjs "$PROJECT_DIR"
```

It reads `capture/extracted/tokens.json` (enriched sections + local image map) + `design-system/inference.json` (brand color), and emits `$PROJECT_DIR/page-card.html`: a golden structure, injected brand color, content/**local image map**, split `.kw` words, selected `.pop-target`, and a preliminary timeline. **But it emits a standalone document** (`<!doctype>` / `<head>` / CDN gsap `<script>` / `<div id="root" data-composition-id="main">` without `<scene-id>-root` class / no `<template>`). Your output contract requires a fragment — finish in this order:

0. **Standalone → fragment conversion** (self-check/gates all validate the fragment contract; missing this step trips the root contract / data-composition-id / timeline-registration FATALs):
   - Strip `<!doctype>` / `<html>` / `<head>` / `<body>` wrappers and the CDN gsap `<script>` (GSAP is injected once in `index.html` by Step 7), and wrap `#root` in `<template id="scene_<N>-template">`.
   - root div: add `class="scene_<N>-root"`, change `data-composition-id="main"` → `scene_<N>`, **delete only `data-start="0"`** (`data-width="1920"` / `data-height="1080"` must stay — they are part of the root 5 attributes; deleting them along with `data-start` triggers a root-contract FATAL), and set `data-duration` to the dispatch `estimatedDuration_s` (exactly, constraint #12).
   - `<style>`: `:root { }` → `#root { }`; fold bare `html,body { }` and bare `* { }` into `#root` / `#root *` (constraint #1).
   - `window.__timelines["main"]` → `window.__timelines["scene_<N>"]` (constraint #8; this host-id / registration-key rename is **not** covered by step 1's "sync timeline selectors"; do it separately).
1. Prefix all classes/ids with `s<N>-`, and sync timeline selectors.
2. Fill `data-glow-start/end` for each `.kw` from ASR (words left blank simply do not glow; render will not fail).
3. Use the script's suggested `SCROLL_DISTANCE`, measure `#pop-target` rect to calibrate, and sync the `.spotlight` gradient center.

Rewrite image `src` in `page-card.html` from `capture/assets/<file>` to **`public/<basename>`** (remove the `capture/assets/` prefix and keep only the filename) — prep flat-copies `capture/assets/**` into `public/`, preserving basenames; `public/` is the only asset surface that gates validate and render-time guarantees. `capture/` is a capture-stage directory and **does not enter the render surface** (writing `capture/assets/...` bypasses all gates and may fail at render time). **Do not switch back to remote URLs** (hotlinking/offline render can break images). For fidelity details, you may **read only for reference** from `capture/extracted/page.html` (read it, but do not render from it).

## Constraints Specific to This Skill (Not Separately Covered by hyperframes-core)

Workers must execute these constraints exactly. hyperframes-core already covers the rest (`<template>` required, no `Math.random` / `Date.now` / `repeat:-1`, no `display`/`visibility` animation, build timelines synchronously), so they are not repeated here; trust that you have read `SKILL.md`.

1. **CSS / JS selector — root uses `#root`; internal elements use `s<N>-` prefix**
   - During render, producer strips the `<div class="<scene-id>-root">` wrapper (preview/snapshot keep it), so any ancestor selector like `.<scene-id>-root .foo` breaks completely in render.
   - **Rule:** all scene-internal classes / ids use the `s<N>-` prefix (scene_1 → `s1-foo`), selectors are written **bare** as `.s1-foo` / `#s1-foo`; JS is synced: `querySelector(".s1-foo")` / `tl.to(".s1-foo", ...)`. Root styles are only written as `#root { ... }`.
   - **Forbidden:** `.<scene-id>-root` / `#<scene-id>-root` / `[data-composition-id="<sid>"]` / `:root` / bare `body` / bare generic classes (`.card`, etc.) without prefix.
   - **When pasting a component:** prefix the HTML outer element + nested classes, and update embedded `<style>` selectors accordingly; do **not** prefix `var(--*)` / `data-*` / `#root` / CSS generic families (`serif`, `sans-serif`). Missing prefix → sibling scene bleed.

     ```html
     <!-- ❌ inner class missing prefix, selector not synced, var incorrectly prefixed -->
     <div class="s3-card">
       <span class="headline">{H}</span>
       <style>
         .card {
           background: var(--accent);
         }
         .card .headline {
           color: var(--s3-ink);
         }
       </style>
     </div>

     <!-- ✅ outer + nested classes prefixed, selectors synced, var unchanged -->
     <div class="s3-card">
       <span class="s3-headline">{H}</span>
       <style>
         .s3-card {
           background: var(--accent);
         }
         .s3-card .s3-headline {
           color: var(--ink);
         }
       </style>
     </div>
     ```

2. **Never copy `@font-face` into a scene** — Step 7 declares it once in `index.html` `<head>`. Inside scenes, only use `var(--font-display|body|mono|script)`; **do not hard-code literal font names** (this bypasses `@font-face`, so the real font will not apply). If `chunks/tokens.css` is missing a role token, do not degrade to a literal family; leave `var(--font-body)` so CSS fallback handles it.
3. **Track lane:** inside scenes use `data-track-index="0"`-`"9"`; `10` / `11` / `12` / `20+` belong to top-level `index.html` (voice / BGM / captions / SFX, all emitted by Step 7 `assemble-index`). **Do not emit `<audio>` in a scene.**
4. **Asset src has no leading slash** — `public/hero.png`, not `/public/hero.png`.
5. **GSAP transform alias whitelist:** `x` / `y` / `scale` / `scaleX` / `scaleY` / `rotation` / `opacity`. Never tween `width` / `height` / `top` / `left`.
   - **Common first mistake in bridge morphs (constraint #14 outgoing scene will hit this):** when the handoff bboxes differ (e.g. scene_2 ink line `(720,760,480,6)` → scene_3 editor underline `(200,600,700,4)`), the first instinct is to write `tl.to(bridge, { left: 200, top: 600, width: 700, height: 4 })` — **this violates the constraint**. Correct approach: convert bbox delta to transform:
     - Center movement: `dx = newCenterX − oldCenterX`, `dy = newCenterY − oldCenterY` → `x: dx, y: dy`
     - Shape scale: `scaleX = newWidth / oldWidth`, `scaleY = newHeight / oldHeight`
     - Pair with `transform-origin: 50% 50%` (set once in CSS or `gsap.set`)
     - Example (ink line above): `x: -410, y: -161, scaleX: 1.458, scaleY: 0.667`. Done.

5b. **CSS baked `transform: rotate(...)` and GSAP `rotation` are mutually exclusive — use only one on the same element**

- Hidden pitfall: pasted components (such as `feature-card` / `star-burst` / `avatar-portrait`) often include CSS `transform: rotate(var(--bf-tilt-sm-l))`; once the same element is targeted by `tl.to(el, { scale: 1, ... })` or `gsap.fromTo(el, { rotation: -2 }, ...)`, GSAP **overwrites the entire** `style.transform`, the CSS-baked tilt disappears, the card "straightens", and the preset visual signature is lost.
- Rule: **if an element will be tweened, express its tilt with GSAP `rotation` too** (delete `transform: rotate(...)` from CSS and write `rotation: <deg>` in `gsap.set` or the entry `fromTo`). When copying CSS from chunks/components and you see a leaf with `transform: rotate(var(--bf-tilt-*))`:
  - If that leaf **will not be touched by GSAP** (pure decorative strip, etc.) → keep CSS baked, OK.
  - If that leaf appears in a timeline `tl.to/.fromTo/.set` selector → **delete the CSS line**, and move tilt into GSAP (`gsap.set(el, { rotation: -2 })` or `fromTo({...rotation: -2}, {...rotation: -2, ...})` to preserve static tilt).
- The same applies to baked `transform: translate(...)` / `scale(...)` / `skew(...)` — once GSAP animates that element, all baked transform is overwritten. `will-change: transform` does not solve this; it is only a perf hint.

6. **Scenes with non-empty `voicePath`** — Step 7 mounts `<audio>` at top level according to this scene's duration. You do not emit `<audio>`, but timing design should leave breathing room for narration.
   - **Ordinary inter-scene transitions (Tier-B) are not your responsibility:** crossfade / push / etc. are deterministically added by Step 7 `transitions.mjs inject` on your clip **wrapper** (`index.html` layer, **above** your scene), **not inside your scene**. Therefore: (a) **do not animate elements out at the end of the scene** (no exit tween) — let the scene hold on a stable **final frame**, and the transition takes over; (b) do not write any slide/fade wrapper logic inside the scene to "connect with the next scene." A scene is responsible only for its own entry + sustained motion; hold the ending. (Hard rule from hyperframes-animation: exit animations are allowed only in the **last** scene.)
   - **Exception: when dispatch provides `shared_element_bridge`** (Tier-A shared element bridge) — you write that cross-scene morph yourself (the harness cannot reach inside sub-compositions; only you can do it in-scene). See constraint #14.
7. **Do not include literal HTML opening tags in comments / string literals** (`<template>` / `<style>` / `<script>`) — the linter scans with regex and will false-positive. Escape as `&lt;template&gt;` or use plain text.
8. **Timeline registration uses a literal scene id string:** `window.__timelines["scene_1"] = tl;`. Do not wrap it behind a `SID` variable (`check-compositions.mjs` cannot recognize it with regex). The whole `<script>` selector / dataset key / timeline key must use literals.
9. **Macro-camera scenes get a layout escape hatch by default**
   - If `effects` contains any of `coordinate-target-zoom` / `multi-phase-camera` / `camera-cursor-tracking` / `viewport-change` → add `data-layout-allow-overflow="true"` to the outermost zoom/pan wrapper.
   - Reason: the zoom peak necessarily exceeds the 1920×1080 viewport, and `hyperframes inspect` will report `text_box_overflow`. This is by design; declare it in advance.
   - Example: `<div class="s2-zoom-outer" id="s2-zoom-outer" data-layout-allow-overflow="true">`
   - ⚠ **`allow-overflow` only pardons decorative bleed; it does not pardon primary large text**: the perception gate still checks whether display text is clipped by the canvas (`primary-offscreen`, caused by zoom scaling). Pushing brand text/headlines out of frame = bug, not by-design. Only mark that text element with `data-layout-bleed="true"` if large-text bleed is truly intentional.
   - ⚠ **Zooming into an asymmetric target (e.g. companion wider than chip) → measure the offset, do not hand-derive it**: after `await document.fonts.ready`, read the target's real `getBoundingClientRect()` center and bake `TARGET_OFFSET` (`center − viewport_center`); the equal-width card formula gives the **wrong sign** in asymmetric layouts, and 3×+ scaling magnifies the error out of frame. See the `coordinate-target-zoom` rule in `/hyperframes-animation`, section "Getting the offset".
   - ⚠ **Leave scale headroom:** at peak, primary text should be ≤ ~88% canvas width (derive `maxScale = 0.88×W/r.width` from measured dimensions); do not pick round numbers by feel — if text fills the canvas, a slight center offset clips it.
10. **Primary handoff before enter (prevent overlap)**
    - Only one `primary subject` at any moment; all other visible content must be `supporting`.
    - If `creative_brief` has `PrimarySubjectTimeline` / `Handoff`, follow it; do not redesign.
    - Before the new primary enters, the previous primary must `exit` / `hide` / `compact` / `demote to supporting`; **camera pan/zoom/push does not count as a handoff**.
    - Primary has exclusive use of the center safe zone; supporting content must be smaller, lower contrast, less animated, and avoid the primary bbox.
    - Add `data-layout-role="primary|supporting"` and `data-layout-act="<act-name>"` to major groups, to help human review and future CLI audit.
    - Timeline order: first `tl.to(previousPrimary, ...)` to exit/downgrade it, then `tl.fromTo(newPrimary, ...)` for entry.
11. **`#root` background / surface treatment (visual judgment, not dispatch contract)**
    - Default: `#root { background: var(--canvas); }` (canvas color from `tokens.css`).
    - **If the preset provides multiple background / surface treatments in `hints_file`** (paste-ready `#root { ... }` stanzas — e.g. paper texture base, dark authority panel, signal board), **you may choose one** that fits this scene's mood and paste the entire stanza into the scene `<style>`, so the frame feels like this preset rather than "generic SaaS colors." This is a **style choice**; no one forces which one to pick. All `var(--*)` tokens are already defined in `tokens.css`; do not replace them.
    - **Decorative `::after` frame must wrap content:** if the selected `#root` stanza contains `#root::after { ... }` (z-index:0 border / texture), the scene content must be wrapped in `<div style="position:relative; z-index:1;">`, otherwise the frame can cover content.
12. **`data-duration` must equal dispatch `estimatedDuration_s` exactly** — Step 7 `assemble-index.mjs` places the full-film timeline using `group_spec` `start_s`, then checks each scene root `data-duration`; mismatch is **fatal** and blocks all of Step 7 back to you. Do not use an approximate value from `creative_brief`; do not round yourself. This is especially important when `voicePath` is non-empty (global timings for voice / SFX / captions are based on this value).
13. **Bottom caption-band keep-out (HARD constraint — only when dispatch `Captions: enabled`, machine-checked in preflight)**

    **One-line principle:** when `Captions: enabled`, finalize places a full-film word-by-word karaoke pill at the bottom; **the caption band occupies y900-1080 (180px), and every FOREGROUND element's target rendered lower edge must be ≤ y880** (20px safety). Foreground = headline / cards / CTA / button / chip / stat / hero text / quote / key logo / any readable content.

    Geometry (mental-calculate before writing each absolute position; if the lower edge computes to > 880, it is a bug):

    | CSS shape                                        | element lower-edge y formula              | Legal condition            |
    | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
    | `bottom: <B>px` (no `top` / `height`)            | `1080 − B`                                | `B ≥ 200`                  |
    | `top: <T>px` + `height: <H>px`                   | `T + H`                                   | `T + H ≤ 880`              |
    | `top: <T>px` + natural height (estimate)         | `T + content height`                      | `T ≤ 880 − content height` |
    | `top: <T>px` + `bottom: <B>px` (stretched strip) | `1080 − B` (bottom determines lower edge) | `B ≥ 200`                  |
    | flex/grid child + `align-self: end`              | Parent container bottom                   | Parent lower edge ≤ 880    |

    **BACKGROUND exceptions (exempt, may be full-bleed to bottom y1080):**
    - `#root` background / surface decoration / `::before` / `::after` frame / ambient mesh / full-bleed screenshot base layer.
    - Decorative leaf class names — preflight automatically skips selectors containing any of these keywords (split by hyphen/underscore): `bg` / `background` / `dot-grid` / `mesh` / `gradient` / `swell` / `ambient` / `texture` / `noise` / `scanline` / `surface` / `overlay` / `halo` / `glow` / `frame` / `pin` / `corner-pin` / `deco` / `star-burst` / `burst` / `ring` / `stripe` / `rect` / `shadow` / `pulse` / `ripple` / `measure` / `probe` / `hidden` / `scrim` / `backdrop` / `veil` / `fog` / `grain`.
    - Macro-camera overflow wrappers from constraint #9 (with `data-layout-allow-overflow="true"`) — zoom peaks naturally exceed the frame.

    **When `Captions: disabled`:** full-canvas, vertical center y=540, content may extend all the way to y=1080. All constraints above are disabled; positioning is free.

    **Preflight machine check** (Step 7 (2) `captions.mjs keepout`) catches three shapes:
    1. `position: absolute` + `bottom: <X>px`, X < 180 and non-decorative
    2. `position: absolute` + `top: <X>px`, X ≥ 900 and non-decorative
    3. `position: absolute` + statically addable `top + height` > 900 and non-decorative

    Each violation generates quasi-Edit strings (`edit_old` / `edit_new`) and writes them to `finalize_brief.json.caption_keepout.violations[]`; the finalize agent directly runs `Edit(file, edit_old, edit_new)` to fix it. **So a contract mistake is not left for snapshot visual inspection; preflight catches it immediately — check values against the table before writing.**

    **Shapes static analysis cannot catch** (GSAP runtime `translateY`, `transform: translate(...)`, `margin-top:`, natural flex layout pushing content to y > 900, etc.) — these are covered by finalize snapshot visual inspection, but **when writing code still position by the rule "element lower edge y ≤ 880"**; do not intentionally hug the edge.

14. **Shared element bridge (Tier-A morph) — only when a scene's dispatch includes `shared_element_bridge`**

    This is a continuous morph **between two scenes** (e.g. card→avatar, waveform→search box). Unlike Tier-B: **you write the morph inside the scene**, and the harness only crossfades the outer shell at the seam. Therefore both scenes must align on one shared **handoff pose**.

    Dispatch field:

    ```
    shared_element_bridge:
      bridge_id: <kebab-id>      # shared by both scenes, put into data-bridge-id
      role: from | to            # whether this scene exits (from) or enters (to)
      partner: <other scene_id>  # the other scene
      seam_duration_s: <float>   # seam crossfade duration (default 0.25); entering scene must HOLD for this long
    ```

    **Shared contract (both scenes):**
    - Put an element with `data-bridge-id="<bridge_id>"` in the DOM (**attribute exactly as-is; do not prefix it with `s<N>-`** — it must remain stable across scenes; class/id still get normal prefixes). In both scenes this element is the **same visual object** (same content/shape semantics).
    - Agree on a **handoff pose** for the element: a concrete screen bbox (left/top/width/height) + appearance (border radius/background color). The outgoing scene reaches this pose at its end, and the incoming scene starts from it — geometry matches **at the seam**, so the crossfade reads as the same element rather than two ghosts.
    - Express the handoff pose in **each scene's own coordinates** (the two sub-compositions do not share a transform origin; do not align with `x/y` offsets. Write left/top/width/height directly, or an equivalent final transform).

    **`role: from` (outgoing scene):**
    - The element enters + displays normally according to this scene's story.
    - In the **last ~0.5s** of your timeline, tween the element to the handoff pose (move to agreed position, scale, adjust radius); fade/exit the scene's **other** content (headlines, etc.) at the same time.
    - End with the element **held in the handoff pose** through the end of `data-duration`.

    **`role: to` (incoming scene):**
    - The element is **initially** placed at the handoff pose (= outgoing final bbox/appearance, written in this scene's coordinates).
    - **Seam HOLD:** for the first `seam_duration_s` seconds, **do not tween this bridge element** (keep it still in the handoff pose, covering the outer crossfade window — otherwise the seam will show two misaligned ghosts, a pitfall found in prototype testing).
    - After `seam_duration_s`, tween it to its final resting position in this scene, and let other scene content enter.

    **Validation:** `transitions.mjs check-bridge` deterministically checks that both scenes contain an element with the same `data-bridge-id`, and that it is not statically hidden by `display:none` / `opacity:0`. Visual alignment of the handoff pose is checked by finalize in seam snapshots (not statically detectable). Therefore **you must personally align the handoff pose values** (outgoing final left/top/w/h == incoming initial left/top/w/h).

    **Bridge element "initial hidden" must use `gsap.set`; CSS `opacity: 0` / `display: none` is forbidden:**
    - A `role: from` element may not appear until later in its scene (e.g. a scene_2 ink line only appears in Phase E at t=3.6); a `role: to` element may also avoid showing its new pose early (even though during Phase 0 HOLD it is already **at** the handoff pose). The instinct is to start with CSS `opacity: 0`. **Do not do this**: `transitions.mjs check-bridge` scans static CSS; when it sees `opacity: 0`, it classifies the bridge element as "hidden" → fatal.
    - Correct approach: leave CSS `opacity: 1` (or omit opacity so default is 1), and initialize with `gsap.set("#s<N>-bridge", { opacity: 0, ... })` at the top of the timeline. Static scan cannot see it, and runtime hiding still works.
    - paste-ready stanza (`role: to` incoming scene; for `role: from` outgoing scene, change `opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1` as needed):
      ```js
      // Tier-A bridge initial state — gsap.set (not CSS opacity:0) so check-bridge-continuity sees it as statically visible
      gsap.set("#s<N>-bridge", { opacity: 1, rotation: <baked-tilt>, scale: 1, transformOrigin: "50% 50%" });
      ```

    **Do not:** touch `index.html` / the outer shell from inside a scene; prefix the `data-bridge-id` attribute with `s<N>-`; animate the incoming bridge element during the seam window; write CSS `opacity: 0` / `display: none` for the bridge element (use `gsap.set` instead).

## Scope

Only write `<PROJECT_DIR>/compositions/<scene-id>.html`. **Do not** modify `index.html` / copy assets / run `npx hyperframes lint|validate|inspect|snapshot|render` / add or remove effects (if a rule cannot run → STOP and report; do not silently drop it).

Every id in the `effects` list must appear once on the timeline (usually 2-5; **use every input effect, silently drop none**); exact firing time, driven asset/text, and phase all come from `creative_brief` prose (§3 effect→asset mapping + §5 multi-phase choreography). Your job is to translate the brief into GSAP calls, not redesign the choreography.

## Flow

1. Parallel Read the required resources (6 items above)
2. Write `<PROJECT_DIR>/compositions/<scene-id>.html` for each scene (skeleton below)
3. Self-check (the `bash grep` block below); fix before reporting if anything fails
4. One-line report

## Skeleton

Example below uses `scene_1` (for other scenes, replace `scene_1` / `s1-` with the corresponding number):

⚠ root `<div>` 5 attributes + class + style must be **written on the same line** — the self-check regex and `check-compositions` Rule 1 both require "id and class in the same tag" as a single-line match. Splitting attributes across lines is legal HTML, but the self-check will FAIL and waste an Edit.

```html
<template id="scene_1-template">
  <div
    id="root"
    class="scene_1-root"

      #root {

        /* ... */
      }
      .s1-word {
        /* ... */
      }
    </style>

      const EASE = { entry: "power2.out" /* ... */ };
      const DUR = { med: 0.55 /* ... */ };
      window.__timelines = window.__timelines || {};
      const tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
      // Write selectors as bare .s1-foo / #s1-foo (see constraint #1);
      // each effect's fire time comes from creative_brief §3 / §5 (see Scope section).
      const headlineEl = document.querySelector("#s1-headline");
      tl.fromTo(
        ".s1-word",
        { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
        { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: DUR.med, ease: EASE.entry },
        0,
      );
      window.__timelines["scene_1"] = tl;
    </script>
  </div>
</template>
```

> **Component selection is your judgment:** `design_chunks.components` is the full preset component library (not a Phase 3-designated subset). Choose a few components that fit the role description in `creative_brief`; **use only one clear focus component per scene** (multiple hero-level focuses in one scene fight each other). If nothing fits, use fewer / none and let effects + type roles carry the scene; do not force components in.

## Report Template

One line per scene:

```
scene_2: file=compositions/scene_2.html duration=4.83s effects=[3d-page-scroll, hacker-flip-3d] blueprint=based-on:demo-page-scroll-spotlight
```

Plus anomalies (missing asset, ambiguous rule combination, attempted effect drop). Do not write `context.log`.
